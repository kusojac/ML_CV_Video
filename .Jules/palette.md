## 2024-05-20 - Empty State Improvements
**Learning:** Replacing plain text empty states with visually distinct layouts containing actionable icons and buttons significantly reduces friction for first-time users. In this app, many empty lists (like projects or artifacts) default to plain Text widgets.
**Action:** Always scan for `isEmpty` conditionals in lists or grids and replace generic `Text` fallbacks with structured empty states featuring a clear Call-To-Action.

**Learning:** Relying solely on textual instructions or AppBar icons in empty states creates unnecessary friction, as users must scan for actions elsewhere. Providing immediate, contextual Call-To-Action buttons directly inside the empty state significantly improves discoverability and usability.
**Action:** When creating or updating empty list/grid views (`isEmpty` blocks), always include explicitly visible `ElevatedButton` (or similar) Call-To-Action elements within the empty state layout to guide the user's next steps.
